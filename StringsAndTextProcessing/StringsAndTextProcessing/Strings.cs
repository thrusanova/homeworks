         to declare a string variable. The string keyword is an alias for the System.String class. 
        We can create string object using one of the following methods:
         By assigning a string literal to a String variable
         By using a String class constructor
         By using the string concatenation operator (+)
         By retrieving a property or calling a method that returns a string
         By calling a formatting method to convert a value or object to its string representation
         Some of the most important methods in the class string is:string.Split(),stringContain,string.Compare(),
         string.Join,string.Copy,ToString() and others.
