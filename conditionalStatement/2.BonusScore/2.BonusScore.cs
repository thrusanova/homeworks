//Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range  [1…9]  by the following rules: ◦ If the score is between  1  and  3 , the program multiplies it by  10 .
// If the score is between  4  and  6 , the program multiplies it by  100 .
// If the score is between  7  and  9 , the program multiplies it by  1000 .
//If the score is  0  or more than  9 , the program prints  “invalid score” .
